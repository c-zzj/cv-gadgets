# A set of computer vision gadgets

`edges` - edge detection implementation using oriented 2nd derivative of Gaussian, and edge line detection using RANSAC based on Canny edge detector.

`LK_optical_flow` - computation of optical flow using 2D Lucas-Kanade algorithm

`pointcloud` - pointcloud construction and camera translation&rotation simulation based on RGB and depth images and intrinsic&extrinsic parameters.

`epipolar_geometry` - fundamental matrix estimation based on 8-point algorithm and RANSAC; image rectification; coarse depth reconstruction.
